# ðŸ“Š Monday Tasks Collection

This repository contains small Python exercises (referred to as "Monday Tasks") that are designed to strengthen basic programming skills through short, focused problems.

## ðŸ”¹ Task Example: `histogram.py`

The `histogram.py` script processes a list of names and creates a frequency histogram using a dictionary.

### âœ… Objective
Count the number of times each name appears in a given list.

### ðŸ§  Concepts Covered
- `for` loop iteration
- Conditional logic with `if-else`
- Dictionary usage and key-value manipulation
- List traversal

Each file is a self-contained script solving a basic algorithmic task. Future tasks will cover topics like:

String manipulation

File I/O

Basic data analysis

Recursion

Sorting & searching

Working with sets and tuples

Intro to classes and OOP


These tasks are part of a weekly training initiative called "Monday Tasks", intended to:

Build strong foundations in Python

Practice clean and readable code

Promote consistency in learning

Prepare for technical interviews
